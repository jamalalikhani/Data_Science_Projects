# Applying TensorFlow for classifying [MNIST dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database)
In this attempt, I have applied TensorFlow (puthon 3.5 on Ubuntu) to construct the follwing four models:
1. Linear Regression with 1 fully connected layer
2. Multilayer Perceptron Model (MLP) with 3 fully connected layers
3. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with 1 NN layer inside a LSTM cell
4. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with 2 Convolutional/pooling layers and 1 fully connected layer


**Refrences:**
most of the materials are taken from:
[TensorFlow Example of MNIST](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/pros)
[Magnus Pedersen's tutorial](https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/TensorFlow-Tutorials)
[sentdex's tutorial channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGxgnH8y2NM&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfKTOs3Keq_kaG2P55YRn5v)
